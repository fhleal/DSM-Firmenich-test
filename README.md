# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

I might have made some bad choices regarding some libs, most of libs I tried to use had some (or many) issues with React last versions and it took me over than 1 hour to realize it

The endpoints provided were not working to retrieve the images AND test the mutation, so I didn't even tried to build the edit feature, once I couldn't test to make sure everything was working.

I focused on features and didn't have enough time to build the style.

I started to code around 9am and I had 1 hour for lunch break.
